## Text Quoting

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
>
> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

## Alerts

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

## Quoting Code

This is `inline` code quote, versus a code block:

```json
{
  "this is a code block": true,
  "multiple lines": true
}
```

See this [link](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) for valid code block keywords.

## UML Diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```
